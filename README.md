## Before You Start...
Please note that these templates generally suit _my workflow._ I supply them here (_and try to keep them up to date_) so that other members of the community can use them. **By all means**, you should change the templates when you download them--you might want to change the date formats, the trackers, the layout... All in all, this can be used as a base, or out of the box. 

These templates also assume you know how to use the plugins required. If you don't, please refer to the instructions on their repos--I unfortunately don't have the time to write a full-blown tutorial on how to use these files.

With all that out of the way, have fun!

## Required Plugins
- [Dynamic Table of Contents](https://github.com/Aidurber/obsidian-plugin-dynamic-toc)
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) (_ensure JS queries are enabled_)

- [Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks)
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)

### Daily Notes
Daily notes are used to take quick memos, and fill out various inline dataview trackers. They also manage tasks, and allow you to keep a simple view of what's to come, what's to be done, and such. They're quite nice to look at, and having a couple open at a time isn't an eyesore.

### Weekly Notes
Weekly notes are used as a bigger picture of a period of your life. They link automatically to all days of the week, and has a fully automated _Overview_ section where you can see a graph and dataview table of the trackers you choose. The memos in your daily notes get pulled into the _Daily Memos_ section so that you can see everything at a glance.

### Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly Notes
As I don't really have a use case for these types of periodic notes, I doubt that I will make templates for them. If the request is high enough however, I will consider, and perhaps adopt it in my own workflow.
